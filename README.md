# Abstract-Locking-Algorithm-using-two-phase-locking
 Implement abstract locking algorithm using two phase locking. I am using std::lock as it implements two phase locking. For implementing this I have taken 25 keys and then locking/unlocking in batches of 5 and locking 5 keys in one time and implementing two- phase locking.
